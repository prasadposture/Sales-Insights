# Sales-Insights
I built a PowerBI Dashboard using Kaggle's Store Sales data. The goal of this project was to analyze the sales data of various stores and identify trends that could help the business make better decisions. By creating an interactive dashboard, I was able to visualize the data in a way that made it easy to understand and identify key insights. <br>
