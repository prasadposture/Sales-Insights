<h1 align='center'> Sales Insights </h1>

### Introduction
The goal of this project was to analyze the sales data of various stores and identify trends that could help the business make better decisions. The dashboard was designed to help users gain insights into the sales performance of the company by analyzing various sales metrics such as total sales, quantity of products sold, sales over months and holidays, and more. The data used here is collected from Kaggle. It's store-sales data that contains multiple tables having inter-relation between them. It was imported into the PowerBI desktop app through ETL processes provided by PowerQuerry. The dashboard was designed to be user-friendly and interactive, allowing users to filter and drill down into the data to gain deeper insights.
